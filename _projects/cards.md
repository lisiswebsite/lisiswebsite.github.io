      I carried the concept of the institution's cutting-edge reputation into
      reality. The Saatchi gallery is known for it’s sometimes controversial art
      and confidence, which I hinted at in the logo by introducing sharp 45°
      angles which give a suggestion of brash menace.

      I wanted to re-imagine the brand to project a more modern image which
      could comfortably extend across digital and print platforms, from the
      responsive website to promotional items such as posters and banners, as
      well as magazines that I chose to be in the format of newspapers to
      reflect the cutting edge, newsworthy art being displayed within the
      gallery.
