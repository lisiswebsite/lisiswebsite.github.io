 When I was seventeen, I drew this little character. Its name is Bird Cape Hero.

      I also experimented with screen printing so I could make Bird Cape Hero shirts for my friends.

      Six years later, I returned to Bird Cape Hero again for a school animation project. Bird Cape Hero has always been a reflection of myself, so I made a video about being far from home - something I dealt with in both undergrad and graduate school. I moved across the country to begin each of those experiences, so this project was about traveling great distances to be reunited with loved ones, even if only for a short amount of time.
